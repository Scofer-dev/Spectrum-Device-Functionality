Mod to add functionality to the Spectrum Device in Arma 3

This mod adds four modules to provide functionality for the Spectrum Device without the Contact DLC being activated.
This means that the Spectrum Device can be used in multiplayer without all players requiring the Contact DLC.

Please Note: This only displays signals, none of the functionality from Contact such as hearing or transmitting on the signals is possible with this mod.
If you want the full Spectrum Device experience, you must use the Contact Platform. That said, Iâ€™m adding features where I can.

A current limitation of this mod is that only a single unit can accurately use the Spectrum Device. This is due to how the game displays signals on the device. 
The signal frequencies and strengths are defined in a hard-coded global variable, so whilst multiple people can use the Spectrum Device at the same time, 
they will all see the exact same display regardless of where they are.

The attachment for the Spectrum Device doesn't matter, the frequency range displayed on the Spectrum Device will remain the same as defined in the Device Settings module.
